      <description>Recently I was reading this article which states that new fossil of the dinosaur called as neosauropods, which walk on the same earth as we are walking around 174 million years ago beating their previous fossil found which was ranging between 163 million to 143 million years ago.
At one side I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated thinking that what all technology can achieve by finding this hidden truths and how much more mystery is hidden on the very earth we are breathing and on the other side thinking about our life span in compare to the life span of earth will be millions into billions into trillion times shorter.</description>

      <description>Our time on earth is limited, person who was alive yesterday and with whom you may have shared those bad, ugly or good moments could be gone tomorrow.
So make most of it today
 Just tackle todays problem Helps others in whatever way you can today Smile today at that stranger on road or park or in parking Create something new today Love yourself and others today   Just couple months back (June&amp;rsquo;18) my flat mate had gone for a business trip to Ohio for couple of weeks and the only news about him I got in those couple of weeks was he took his last breath.</description>
