      <description>Our time on earth is limited, person who was alive yesterday and with whom you may have shared those bad, ugly or good moments could be gone tomorrow.
So make most of it today
 Just tackle todays problem Helps others in whatever way you can today Smile today at that stranger on road or park or in parking Create something new today Love yourself and others today   Just couple months back (June&amp;rsquo;18) my flat mate had gone for a business trip to Ohio for couple of weeks and the only news about him I got in those couple of weeks was he took his last breath.</description>
