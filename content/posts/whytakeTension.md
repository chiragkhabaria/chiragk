Recently I was reading this [article](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/species-dinosaur-dubbed-amazing-dragon-discovered-china/story?id=56790120)  which states that new fossil of the dinosaur called as neosauropods, which walk on the same earth as we are walking around 174 million years ago beating their previous fossil found which was ranging between 163 million to 143 million years ago. 

 At one side I'm fascinated thinking that what all technology can achieve by finding this hidden truths and how much more mystery is hidden on the very earth we are breathing and on the other side thinking about our life span in compare to the life span of earth will be millions into billions into trillion times shorter. 

Made me realize, why do we need to take so much stress and tension of everything happening around us as the whole earth will collapse if we miss out on something. 

Everything around us was there from million of years before us and going to be there for million years after us. When we born we take everything from the nature use them and then while going back we give everything to nature, so its like we are just renting from the nature and he is going to take everything back from us when we are dead. 

So why take tension ?

- We are  all trap in this moment, so lets make a conscious effort to live this moment in bliss and happiness. 
- Do only those things that are important, *since stupid people will do everything that comes in their way, smart people will do  things they love and genius are those who does things that are important. So strive for being genius.* 
- Mediate and get to know yourself better. It famously said the better your know the machine better you can operate. In all the rush and hush of life we know so many things but do we know our self?
- Problems will always be there, once you finish something there is a something new waiting for you to pick up and  that will give all set of new problems, so why worry about it just let tackle it and move forward. *We can just take one breath at time so similarly just solve one problem at the time.*
