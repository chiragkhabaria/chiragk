Our time on earth is limited, person who was alive yesterday and with whom you may have shared those bad, ugly or good moments could be gone tomorrow. 

So make most of it today

- Just tackle todays problem 
- Helps others in whatever way you can today
- Smile today at that stranger on road or park or in parking
- Create something  new today
- Love yourself and others today
	

Just couple months back (June'18)  my flat mate had gone for a business trip to Ohio for couple of weeks and the only news about him I got in those couple of weeks was he took his last breath. Needless to say it was a shocker for me and my other flat mate but that made me realize that is life is too short and it may just go away. 

Try to create that magical moments with your loved once now in this moment, because when they are gone it's only these moments will be alive within you for rest of your life.

So just do it today 

- Hug your loved one today
- Meet your mother and father today
- Call or meet your old high school friend today
- Have that pending dinner date with your wife today


*One thing anyone can predict about anyone is that he/she is surely going to die, only we donâ€™t know when, so live a complete and full life before you leave life.*
